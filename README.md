# ToDoList

The main purpose of this project is to create a fun To Do App for users to use. When you open the App, it will show the Exact Day, and Month.
You can also include additional Task for the day as well! I also create a Fun About Me and Work Page for users that have multiple (but different) task
to tackle on for the day.
